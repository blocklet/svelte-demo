## What is Publish Kit?

A powerful yet simple content engine for you to publish any content, without any ads.

Currently, supported content formats are:

- Status: short and concise twitter like text messages, can be composed with markdown!
- Gallery: a collection of images with a short description
- Blog: long and rich text blog post, full github-flavored-markdown support!

## Why Publish Kit?

Admit it or not, the current content publish services are either ate by ads or being eating by ads, besides, you do not actually own the data you published on any service.

Publish Kit can change all this with the distributed application engine: blocklet server.

## How to use Publish Kit?

Publish Kit can be used to publish and host contents for personal and team purpose, all you need is a running blocklet-server(you can purchase one [here](https://launcher.arcblock.io/)) and [DID Wallet](http://www.didwallet.io/).

By default, only the blocklet owner can publish content on a running Publish Kit instance, if you are planning a team usage, you can invite team members by issuing `admin` passports for them.

## Publish Kit Roadmap

- [x] support basic content publishing
- [ ] support content publish to paid users with crypto
- [ ] support content publish to subscribed users with crypto
- [ ] support social feed aggregation, perhaps this will go into another blocklet
